        <h1>Privacy Policy for Dissatisfied</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: {lastUpdated}</p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of
          information when you use the Service and explains your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
          Right now, we do not collect Personal Data. If we introduce data collection in the future, we will
          update this policy first and clearly describe what is collected, why, and how it’s used.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This page was adapted from common templates to fit
          our product and our current stance: no data collection today; possible limited collection in future with prior notice.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
